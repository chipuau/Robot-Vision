To compile canny.c, use "gcc canny.c" and "./a.out." The pgm file for garb34.pgm 
is written into the code, and I have included it in the .zip file. If testing
using Ubuntu, you may need to type "gcc canny.c -lm" instead. 

The program will output three files-- CannyMagnitude.pgm, CannyPeaks.pgm, and
CannyThresholds.pgm. I had some difficulty getting the exact output specified
in the assignment specifications, but I adjusted the peak and percent values
to get it as close as possible.
