To compile sobel.c, use gcc sobel.c and ./a.out. The .pgm file face05.pgm 
is written into the code. 

The output files are labeled NOThreshold, LOThreshold, and HIThreshold. 
NOThreshold is the magnitude image, LOThreshold is the resulting image with a
threshold of 24, and HIThreshold is the resulting image with a threshold of 48.
The threshold values were chosen as multiples of 4 to ensure that the 1/4 factor
could be removed.
